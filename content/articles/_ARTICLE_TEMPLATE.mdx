# Your Article Title

## Introduction

Start with a brief introduction that explains what the article covers and why it matters. This should expand on your description and provide context for the reader.

## Main Section 1

Begin with your first main topic. Break complex concepts into smaller, digestible chunks.

### Sub-section 1.1

Provide more detailed information or examples related to the main section.

```javascript
// Example code block
function exampleFunction() {
  console.log("This is an example code snippet");
  return "Use code blocks to illustrate concepts";
}
```

### Sub-section 1.2

Continue with related information, building on previous concepts.

## Main Section 2

Move on to your next major topic.

- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- They help break up text and make it more scannable
- Keep bullet points concise and parallel in structure

## Interactive Elements

### Quiz Example

You can add interactive quizzes to test the reader's understanding:

<Quiz

  type="multipleChoice"
  options={[
    {
      label: "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces",
      correct: true,
    },
    { label: "A programming language", correct: false },
    { label: "A database management system", correct: false },
    { label: "A server-side framework", correct: false },
  ]}
  explanation="React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications."
/>

### True/False Quiz Example

<TrueFalseQuiz
  question="JavaScript is a statically typed language."
  correct={false}
  explanation="JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile time."
/>

### Fill in the Blank Quiz Example

<FillInTheBlankQuiz
  question="What function is used to add an event listener to a DOM element in JavaScript?"
  answers={["addEventListener", "element.addEventListener"]}
  explanation="The addEventListener method is used to attach an event handler to a specified element."
  placeholder="Type your answer here"
/>

### Button Examples

#### Button Variants

<Button variant="primary">Primary Button</Button>

<Button variant="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>

<Button variant="outline">Outline Button</Button>

<Button variant="ghost">Ghost Button</Button>

#### Link Buttons

Buttons can also function as links:

<Button href="https://dotcodeschool.com" variant="primary" target="_blank">
  Visit Dot Code School
</Button>

<Button href="/articles" variant="secondary">
  Browse Articles
</Button>

#### Button Sizes

<Button variant="primary" size="sm">Small Button</Button>

<Button variant="primary" size="md">Medium Button</Button>

<Button variant="primary" size="lg">Large Button</Button>

## Practical Example

Provide a practical, real-world example that demonstrates the concepts discussed in the article.

```rust
// A more complex code example
#[pallet::weight(10_000)]
pub fn create_item(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    item_id: u32,
    item_name: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    
    // Add comments to explain what the code does
    ensure!(!ItemExists::<T>::contains_key(item_id), Error::<T>::ItemAlreadyExists);
    
    let bounded_name: BoundedVec<_, _> = item_name.try_into()
        .map_err(|_| Error::<T>::NameTooLong)?;
        
    Items::<T>::insert(item_id, (bounded_name, sender.clone()));
    
    Self::deposit_event(Event::ItemCreated(item_id, sender));
    
    Ok(())
}
```
