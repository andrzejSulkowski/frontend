## Introduction

Dot Code School now supports courses created using MDX (Markdown with JSX) files stored directly in the repository. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Version Control**: All course content is stored in Git, making it easy to track changes and collaborate
- **Local Development**: Authors can preview their courses locally before submitting
- **Simplified Workflow**: No need to use a separate CMS or content platform
- **Flexibility**: Easy to include code examples, interactive elements, and custom components

## Course Structure

Our courses follow a hierarchical structure:

```
content/courses/course-slug/
├── course-slug.mdx           # Course metadata and description
└── sections/                 # Container for all course sections
    └── section-slug/         # A section of the course
        ├── section-slug.mdx  # Section metadata
        └── lessons/          # Container for all lessons in this section
            ├── lesson-1-slug/    # First lesson directory
            │   ├── lesson-1-slug.mdx  # Lesson content
            │   └── files/        # Optional code files for the lesson
            │       └── source/   # OR template/ and solution/ pair
            └── lesson-2-slug/    # Second lesson directory
                ├── lesson-2-slug.mdx  # Lesson content
                └── files/        # Optional code files
                    ├── template/ # Files with TODOs for learners
                    └── solution/ # Completed files for reference
```

## Creating a New Course

To create a new course:

### Option 1: Using the Template Directory

1. Copy the `content/courses/course-template` directory to create a new course with the recommended structure
2. Rename the directory to your course slug (e.g., `javascript-basics`)
3. Rename `course-template.mdx` to match your course slug (e.g., `javascript-basics.mdx`)
4. Edit the course metadata and content in the renamed file
5. Customize the sections and lessons to fit your course content

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to start from scratch:

1. Create a new directory under `content/courses/` with your course slug
2. Create a course metadata file named after your course slug
3. Create a `sections` directory to contain your course sections

### Course Metadata File

The course metadata file (e.g., `javascript-basics.mdx`) should include frontmatter with the following fields:

```mdx
---
slug: javascript-basics
title: JavaScript Basics
author: Your Name
author_url: https://github.com/your-username
description: A concise description of your course.
level: Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced
language: Programming language(s) used
github_url: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
tags: ["javascript", "web development", "programming"]
prerequisites:
  [
    "Basic understanding of HTML and CSS",
    "Familiarity with programming concepts",
  ]
what_youll_learn:
  [
    "Variables and data types",
    "Functions and scope",
    "Objects and arrays",
    "DOM manipulation",
    "Asynchronous programming",
  ]
estimated_time: 5 # Estimated time to complete in hours
last_updated: "2025-05-04" # Date when the course was last updated
---

# JavaScript Basics

This course will teach you the fundamentals of JavaScript programming...
```

The frontmatter includes these required fields:

- `slug`: Unique identifier for the course (should match directory name)
- `title`: Display title for the course
- `author`: Your name or organization
- `author_url`: Link to your GitHub profile or website
- `description`: A concise description of the course content
- `level`: Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced)
- `language`: Programming language(s) used in the course
- `github_url`: Repository URL (if applicable)
- `tags`: Array of relevant keywords
- `prerequisites`: Array of required knowledge or skills
- `what_youll_learn`: Array of key concepts or skills covered
- `estimated_time`: Approximate hours to complete the course

## Adding Sections and Lessons

### Creating a Section

1. Create a directory for your section under `sections/` with a descriptive slug (e.g., `getting-started`)
2. Create a section metadata file (e.g., `getting-started.mdx`) in your section directory
3. Create a `lessons` directory within your section to contain individual lessons

### Section Metadata

Your section metadata file (e.g., `getting-started.mdx`) should include frontmatter with the following fields:

```mdx
---
slug: getting-started
title: Getting Started
order: 1 # Determines the order of sections within the course
description: A brief description of what this section covers
---

This section introduces the basic concepts of JavaScript and helps you set up your development environment.
```

### Creating a Lesson

1. Create a directory for your lesson under `lessons/` with a descriptive slug (e.g., `variables`)
2. Create an MDX file for your lesson content (e.g., `variables.mdx`)
3. Optionally, create a `files` directory if your lesson includes code examples

### Lesson Metadata

Each lesson MDX file should include frontmatter with at least:

```mdx
---
slug: variables
title: Working with Variables
order: 1 # Determines the order of lessons within a section
last_updated: "2025-05-04" # Date when the lesson was last updated
---

# Working with Variables

In this lesson, you'll learn about variables in JavaScript...
```

## Working with Code Files

Each lesson can have an optional `files` directory that must follow one of these patterns:

### Source Directory

Use a `source` directory when you want to show the final state of files after an action is taken, without requiring the learner to implement anything themselves:

```
files/
└── source/
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    └── script.js
```

The `source` directory is ideal for:

- Initial setup steps
- Demonstrating concepts without requiring implementation
- Providing reference code that learners can examine

### Template and Solution Directories

Use `template` and `solution` directories when you want learners to implement something themselves:

```
files/
├── template/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── script.js  # Contains TODOs and instructions
└── solution/
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    └── script.js  # Contains the completed implementation
```

The `template`/`solution` pair is ideal for:

- Hands-on coding exercises where learners implement features
- Teaching specific programming patterns or techniques
- Guiding learners through a step-by-step implementation

#### Template Files

Template files should include clear TODO comments that guide the learner on what to implement:

```javascript
// TODO: Declare a variable named 'greeting' using the 'const' keyword
// TODO: Assign the string "Hello, world!" to the greeting variable
// TODO: Use console.log to output the greeting to the console
```

#### Solution Files

Solution files should contain the complete, working implementation:

```javascript
// Declare a variable named 'greeting' using the 'const' keyword
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
// Use console.log to output the greeting to the console
console.log(greeting);
```

## Creating a Pull Request

When you're ready to contribute your course or changes:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages
4. Push your branch to your fork
5. Create a pull request to the main repository

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Your course follows the directory structure outlined in this guide
- [ ] Your course metadata file includes all required fields
- [ ] All section and lesson files include proper frontmatter
- [ ] Code examples in template/solution pairs match correctly
- [ ] All links to files use relative paths and are correct
- [ ] Your content is free of spelling and grammatical errors

## Best Practices

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Structure your course to gradually increase in complexity
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for each task
3. **Explain Why**: Don't just show what to do, explain why it's done that way
4. **Complete Examples**: Ensure your code examples are complete and functional
5. **Consistent Style**: Maintain a consistent writing style throughout your course
6. **Target Audience**: Clearly indicate the prerequisite knowledge for your course
7. **Test Your Code**: Verify that all code examples work as expected
8. **Review Your Content**: Have someone else review your course before submitting

By following this guide, you'll create courses that are consistent with our platform's standards and provide an excellent learning experience for our users.

Happy teaching!
