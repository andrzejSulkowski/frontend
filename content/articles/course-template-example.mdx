# Course Template Example

This template provides a concrete example of how to structure your course files. You can use this as a reference when creating your own courses.

## Example Course Structure

Below is an example of a minimal course structure for a JavaScript basics course:

```
content/courses/javascript-basics/
├── javascript-basics.mdx       # Course metadata and description
├── README.md                   # Instructions for course authors/contributors
└── sections/
    ├── getting-started/
    │   ├── getting-started.mdx  # Optional section metadata
    │   └── lessons/
    │       ├── introduction/
    │       │   └── introduction.mdx
    │       └── setup-environment/
    │           ├── setup-environment.mdx
    │           └── files/
    │               └── source/
    │                   └── hello.js
    └── variables-and-types/
        └── lessons/
            ├── variables/
            │   ├── variables.mdx
            │   └── files/
            │       ├── template/
            │       │   └── variables.js
            │       └── solution/
            │           └── variables.js
            └── data-types/
                └── data-types.mdx
```

Each course includes a README.md file that provides instructions for authors and contributors. This file explains how to use the template, the structure of the course, and best practices for creating content.

# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It allows you to add interactivity to websites and create dynamic user experiences.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was originally designed to be a scripting language for the Netscape Navigator web browser.

Today, JavaScript is used for:

1. Front-end web development
2. Back-end server development (Node.js)
3. Mobile app development
4. Desktop application development
5. Game development

## Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Here are some reasons to learn it:

- It's essential for web development
- It has a large and active community
- It's versatile and can be used for various types of applications
- It's in high demand in the job market

In the next lesson, we'll set up our development environment and write our first JavaScript program.
```

### Template File Example (variables.js in template directory)

```javascript
// TODO: Declare a variable named 'greeting' using the 'const' keyword and assign it the value 'Hello, world!'

// TODO: Create a variable named 'myName' using 'let' and assign it your name

// TODO: Create a variable named 'age' using 'let' and assign it your age

// TODO: Log a message to the console that uses both variables, like: "Hello, my name is [myName] and I am [age] years old."

// TODO: Try to reassign the 'greeting' variable and observe what happens
```

### Solution File Example (variables.js in solution directory)

```javascript
// Declare a variable named 'greeting' using the 'const' keyword
const greeting = "Hello, world!";

// Create a variable named 'myName' using 'let'
let myName = "Jane Doe";

// Create a variable named 'age' using 'let'
let age = 30;

// Log a message to the console that uses both variables
console.log(`${greeting} My name is ${myName} and I am ${age} years old.`);

// Try to reassign the 'greeting' variable
// This will cause an error because 'greeting' is a constant
// Uncomment the line below to see the error
// greeting = 'Hi there!';
```

## Using This Template

To use this template for your own course:

### Option 1: Using the Helper Script

1. Navigate to the `content/courses/course-template` directory in your terminal
2. Run the helper script with your desired course slug:
   ```bash
   ./create-course.sh your-course-slug
   ```
3. The script will create a new course directory with the proper structure
4. Follow the instructions provided by the script to customize your course

The helper script (`create-course.sh`) automates the following tasks:

- Creates a new directory with your course slug
- Copies all template files and directories to the new location
- Renames the course metadata file to match your course slug
- Removes the script itself from the new course directory
- Provides clear next steps for customizing your course

This is the recommended approach for creating new courses as it ensures all necessary files and directories are properly set up.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Copy the `content/courses/course-template` directory, which contains a ready-to-use template structure with all the examples shown above
2. Rename the directory to your course slug (e.g., `javascript-basics`)
3. Rename `course-template.mdx` to match your course slug (e.g., `javascript-basics.mdx`)
4. Replace the example content with your own course material
5. Ensure you maintain the same file naming conventions and directory structure
6. Update the metadata in the course and lesson files to reflect your content

The template directory includes a README.md file with detailed instructions on how to customize it for your specific course.

Remember to follow the guidelines in the [Course Contribution Guide](./course-contribution-guide) for detailed instructions on creating and formatting your course content.
