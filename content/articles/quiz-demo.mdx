# Interactive Quizzes in Lessons

This article demonstrates how to use interactive quizzes to enhance the learning experience. Quizzes help reinforce concepts and provide immediate feedback to learners.

## What are Interactive Quizzes?

Interactive quizzes are self-checking questions that allow learners to test their understanding of the material. They provide immediate feedback and explanations to help learners understand why an answer is correct or incorrect.

## Multiple Choice Quizzes

The most common type of quiz is multiple choice. Here's an example:

<Quiz
  question="What is the command to initialize a new git repository?"
  type="multipleChoice"
  options={[
    { label: "git init", correct: true },
    { label: "git start", correct: false },
    { label: "init git", correct: false },
    { label: "git new", correct: false },
  ]}
  explanation="The correct command is `git init`, which initializes a new git repository in the current directory. This creates a .git folder that contains all the necessary repository files."
/>

<Quiz
  question="Which of the following is NOT a JavaScript framework or library?"
  type="multipleChoice"
  options={[
    { label: "React", correct: false },
    { label: "Angular", correct: false },
    { label: "Vue", correct: false },
    { label: "Java", correct: true },
  ]}
  explanation="Java is a programming language, not a JavaScript framework or library. React, Angular, and Vue are all JavaScript frameworks/libraries used for building web applications."
/>

## True/False Quizzes

For simple binary questions, you can use the TrueFalseQuiz component:

<TrueFalseQuiz
  question="React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook."
  correct={true}
  explanation="React is indeed a JavaScript library that was developed by Facebook (now Meta) for building user interfaces."
/>

<TrueFalseQuiz
  question="TypeScript is a replacement for JavaScript that cannot be used in web browsers."
  correct={false}
  explanation="TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, but it compiles down to JavaScript and can be used anywhere JavaScript can be used, including web browsers."
/>

## Fill in the Blank Quizzes

For questions where users need to type an answer, use the FillInTheBlankQuiz component:

<FillInTheBlankQuiz
  question="What function is used to add an event listener to a DOM element in JavaScript?"
  answers={["addEventListener", "element.addEventListener"]}
  explanation="The addEventListener method is used to attach an event handler to a specified element."
  placeholder="Type your answer here"
/>

<FillInTheBlankQuiz
  question="What CSS property is used to change the text color?"
  answers={["color"]}
  caseSensitive={false}
  explanation="The 'color' property is used to set the color of text in CSS."
/>

## Quiz Groups

You can group related quizzes together to calculate a total score using the QuizGroup component:

<QuizGroup
  title="JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz"
  description="Test your knowledge of JavaScript basics"
>
  <Quiz
    question="Which of the following is a primitive data type in JavaScript?"
    type="multipleChoice"
    options={[
      { label: "Array", correct: false },
      { label: "Object", correct: false },
      { label: "String", correct: true },
      { label: "Function", correct: false },
    ]}
    explanation="String is a primitive data type in JavaScript. The primitive data types are: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint."
  />

<TrueFalseQuiz
  question="JavaScript is a statically typed language."
  correct={false}
  explanation="JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means variable types are determined at runtime, not at compile time."
/>

  <FillInTheBlankQuiz
    question="What method is used to add an item to the end of an array in JavaScript?"
    answers={["push", "array.push"]}
    explanation="The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array."
  />
</QuizGroup>

## Using JSX in Explanations

You can use JSX elements in the explanation to provide more detailed feedback:

<Quiz
  question="What does JSX stand for?"
  type="multipleChoice"
  options={[
    { label: "JavaScript XML", correct: true },
    { label: "JavaScript Extension", correct: false },
    { label: "JavaScript Syntax", correct: false },
    { label: "Java Syntax Extension", correct: false },
  ]}
  explanation={
    <>
      <p>
        JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript
        recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        JSX produces React "elements" that can be rendered to the DOM. It looks
        like HTML but comes with the full power of JavaScript.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;`}</code>
      </pre>
    </>
  }
/>
