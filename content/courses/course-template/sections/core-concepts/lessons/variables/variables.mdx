# Working with Variables

Variables are a fundamental concept in programming. They allow us to store and manipulate data in our programs. In this lesson, we'll learn how to declare, initialize, and work with variables.

## What are Variables?

Variables are named containers for storing data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information that your program can use later.

## Declaring Variables

In [language], there are several ways to declare variables:

```javascript
// Example variable declarations
var oldWay = "This is the older way to declare variables";
let modern = "This is the modern way to declare variables";
const constant = "This value cannot be changed";
```

## Variable Types

[Language] supports several data types:

- **Strings**: Text values, like `"Hello, World!"`
- **Numbers**: Numeric values, like `42` or `3.14`
- **Booleans**: `true` or `false` values
- **Arrays**: Collections of values, like `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Objects**: Collections of key-value pairs, like `{ name: "John", age: 30 }`

## Variable Scope

The scope of a variable determines where in your code the variable can be accessed:

- **Global scope**: Variables declared outside of any function
- **Function scope**: Variables declared within a function
- **Block scope**: Variables declared within a block (using `let` or `const`)

## Exercise: Working with Variables

In this exercise, you'll practice working with variables by creating a simple program that:

1. Declares variables of different types
2. Performs operations with these variables
3. Outputs the results to the console

You'll find the starter code in the `files/template` directory and the solution in the `files/solution` directory.

## Key Takeaways

- Variables are used to store and manipulate data in your programs
- Different variable declaration keywords (`var`, `let`, `const`) have different behaviors
- Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing maintainable code
- Choosing the right data type for your variables is important for program efficiency

In the next lesson, we'll explore [next topic] and how it relates to variables.
