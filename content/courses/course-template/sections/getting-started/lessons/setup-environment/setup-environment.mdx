# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into coding, let's set up a proper development environment. This will ensure you have all the tools you need to follow along with the course.

## Required Software

For this course, you'll need to install the following software:

1. [Software 1] - This is the main tool we'll be using
2. [Software 2] - This will help us with [specific task]
3. [Software 3] - Optional but recommended for [specific reason]

## Installation Instructions

### Installing [Software 1]

1. Go to the official website: [website URL]
2. Download the installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
[verification command]
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[expected output]
```

### Installing [Software 2]

## Creating Your First Project

Now that you have all the necessary tools installed, let's create a simple project to verify everything is working correctly.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project
3. Run the following command:

```bash
[project creation command]
```

4. Open the project in your preferred code editor

## Hello World Example

Let's create a simple "Hello World" program to test our setup:

1. Create a new file named `hello.js` in your project directory
2. Add the following code to the file:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

3. Save the file
4. Run the program using the following command:

```bash
node hello.js
```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed in your terminal.

The complete code for this example is available in the `files/source` directory for this lesson.
